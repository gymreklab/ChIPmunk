  abstract      = "Summary: BWA-MEM is a new alignment algorithm for aligning
                   sequence reads or long query sequences against a large
                   reference genome such as human. It automatically chooses
                   between local and end-to-end alignments, supports paired-end
                   reads and performs chimeric alignment. The algorithm is
                   robust to sequencing errors and applicable to a wide range
                   of sequence lengths from 70bp to a few megabases. For
                   mapping 100bp sequences, BWA-MEM shows better performance
                   than several state-of-art read aligners to date.
                   Availability and implementation: BWA-MEM is implemented as a
                   component of BWA, which is available at
                   http://github.com/lh3/bwa. Contact:

  abstract = "SUMMARY: The Sequence Alignment/Map (SAM) format is a generic
              alignment format for storing read alignments against reference
              sequences, supporting short and long reads (up to 128 Mbp)
              produced by different sequencing platforms. It is flexible in
              style, compact in size, efficient in random access and is the
              format in which alignments from the 1000 Genomes Project are
              released. SAMtools implements various utilities for
              post-processing alignments in the SAM format, such as indexing,
              variant caller and alignment viewer, and thus provides universal
              tools for processing read alignments. AVAILABILITY:
